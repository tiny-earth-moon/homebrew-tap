    # periphery links @rpath/libIndexStore.dylib and swift-index-store only adds the building
    # Xcode to the rpath, e.g. /Applications/Xcode_27.2.app on a CI runner. A bottle must find
    # the library on the user's machine: the default Xcode location first, then the Command Line
    # Tools, which homebrew-core's periphery formula also relies on.

    <<~EOS
      The bottle loads libIndexStore.dylib from /Applications/Xcode.app, or else from the
      Command Line Tools. If neither is installed there, build from source instead:
        brew reinstall --build-from-source periphery
